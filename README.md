# Conditional statement and Boolean logic.
you have mostly viewed computer programs as sequences of instructions that are followed one after the other. 

**Sequencing** is a fundamental concept of programming, but it alone is not sufficient to solve every problem.

Often it is necessary to alter the sequential flow of a program to suit the needs of a particular situation. 
This is done with special statements known as **control structures.**
**A control structure** is a logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements get executed.
**A control structure** helps a program make decisions and change the order of execution based on conditions.

a specific action is performed only if a certain condition exists. If the condition does not exist, the action is not performed.
 
We are determining whether the condition, a rainy day today is true or false. If this condition is true, the action stay home is performed. If the condition is false, the action is skipped. The action is conditionally executed because it is performed only when a certain condition is true and this is known as single alternative decision structure because there is only one alternative path of execution.
 
# If Statement
The **if statement** is used to create a decision structure, which allows a program to have more than one path of execution.
Here is the general format of the if statement:
**if condition:
    statement
    statement
    etc.**
We will refer to the first line as the **if clause.** 
-**The if clause** begins with the word if, followed by a condition, which is an expression that will be evaluated as either true or false. A colon (:) appears after the condition.
-Beginning at the next line is a **block of statements.** 
-**A block** is simply a set of statements that belong together as a group. Notice in the general format that all of the statements in the block are indented.
-**This indentation** is required because the python interpreter uses it to where the block start and end.
